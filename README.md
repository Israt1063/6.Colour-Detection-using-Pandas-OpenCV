# 🎨 Color Name Detection from Image using OpenCV and Pandas

This project detects the closest color name from any pixel in an image using **OpenCV**, **Pandas**, and a public color dataset. Ideal for beginners exploring **image processing** and **color recognition** in **Google Colab**.

---

## 📂 Features

- ✅ Load and display an image
- ✅ Get RGB value of a specific pixel (by coordinate)
- ✅ Match RGB to the closest named color
- ✅ Avoid overflow issues with safe type casting
- ✅ Fully compatible with Google Colab

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Colab

---

## 📦 Dataset

- Color names and RGB values are loaded from [CodeBrainz Color Dataset](https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv)

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Colab)

1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload your image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)
3. Paste and run the full script
4. Enter pixel coordinates (X, Y) manually
5. See the RGB values and closest color name in the output
